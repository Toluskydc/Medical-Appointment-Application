# API for a Medical Appointment Application

- The application is to facilitate appointment bookings between Patients and Doctors. 

- A doctor can only have one appointment scheduled with a patient at a time, so if a patient needs to book an appointment and no doctor is available, the API would respond with the proper response and status code
